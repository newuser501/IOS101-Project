I want to build an app that shows when surge prices are likely to happen and give an estimate of the fare at a certain place and time. It could also potentially compare Uber and Lyft side by side and suggest whether you should wait a little or book right away. This way, riders are able to plan smarter and avoid paying extra. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I encountered an outlet error, which was resolved after I got rid of a dangling outlet.
